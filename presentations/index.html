      <h3>Basic 3D Animation</h3>

      <p><em>Please excuse the small blank portion, low audio and cut off ends, this video was filmed before we had a decent recording setup and this is the best video I could find of it. I'd recommend watching this through computer speakers at high volume rather than headphones to avoid damage to ears.</em></p>
      <p>This is a video of my 2018 <a>Personal Learning Project</a> on Basic 3D Animation. This presentation covers my findings over the course of six months as I explored the field I had chosen. Although I am rather unimpressed with my final project, I learned a great deal more than I was able to share, which was a very enjoyable experience for me.</p>

      <h3>Introduction to Whittling</h3>

      <p><em>This is also an incomplete recording with a number of small gaps which I have done my best to fill in. Our recording setup before December 2019 was truly abysmal.</em></p>
      <p>This is my 2019 Personal Learning Project on the basics of whittling. Although I had grand aspirations of learning to carve figures into wood over the course of a year, I ended up mostly scraping bark off a stick (which turned out to be rather informative). Despite my status as a complete novice at both the beginning and the end of the year, I was able to find calm in whittling, which I think is a success.</p>
