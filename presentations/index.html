      <p><i>Please excuse the small blank portion, low audio and cut off ends, this video was filmed before we had a decent recording setup and this is the best video I could find of it. I'd recommend watching this through computer speakers at high volume rather than headphones to avoid damage to ears.</i></p>
      <p>This is a video of my 2018 <a>Personal Learning Project</a> on Basic 3D Animation. This presentation covers my findings over the course of six months as I explored the field I had chosen. Although I am rather unimpressed with my final project, I learned a great deal more than I was able to share, which was a very enjoyable experience for me.</p>
