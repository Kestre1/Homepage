      <br />
      <h11 class='authorsnotetext'>DISCLAIMER: Forget the quality of the previous book in this series, I even more do not endorse the quality of this book!</h11>
      <br />
      <br />
      <h11 class='authorsnotetext'>This is the second book in my very first series, not a full-length novel, but still a sizable story! This book, unlike the previous book, was written during the school year, which dramatically slowed down my writing process. Still, I had fun writing this book, since it represented a far more major emphasis on character development than I've ever done before. Even through hundreds of plot holes, almost 90% incorrect usage of "its" vs "it's", I think I can still declare this book a success, if a sloppy one!</h11>
      <br />
      <br />
      <h11 class='authorsnotetext'>This book took much longer, at 1 chapter a week for about seven or so months. Still, considering the fact that I wrote it while during my first semester of homeschooling, I think I did much better than I could've!</h11>
