      <h11 class='authorsnotetext'>This short story is one I originally wrote in Spring 2019 as part of a "Short Short Fiction" class, which limited me to one page. Upon returning to it in early 2021, I decided to redraft it as a submission for a school anthology (from our Non-Locational Charter School a.k.a. homeschooling funder), this time with a requirement to stay under two pages. Since it was me, I just scraped by that requirement, but I'm rather proud that I was able to get anything under 1,000 words at all!</h11>
