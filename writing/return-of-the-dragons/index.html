      <h9 class='authorsnote'>Author's Note</h9>
      <br />
      <h11 class='authorsnotetext'>DISCLAIMER: I do not endorse the quality of this book, despite having written it! (Sorry, I have to point out that it isn't my best work for my own piece of mind!)</h11>
      <br />
      <br />
      <h11 class='authorsnotetext'>This is the first full-length novel I have ever written! Although I have been writing for many years, it was only now that I was able to muster the long-term inspiration to put out a finished work, and one that exceedes the novel minimum of 40,000 words, no less!</h11>
      <br />
      <br />
      <h11 class='authorsnotetext'>I think a good amount of my success can be attributed to two factors. Number one: this book isn't very good. Number two: I had Wattpad, a site where you can publish stories by chapter, to help me with my need for short term gratification. (As in, getting to publish chapters within short time spans). And number three: it was fanfiction, which not only makes it easier to write, it also helped me let go of my attachment to creating a good book.</h11>
      <br />
      <br />
      <h11 class='authorsnotetext'>The entirety of this 50,000 word fanfiction was drafted in 31 days, with one chapter published per day. Even though I can't imagine readers enjoying it, writing it was fascinating, and I think that's what counts! But should you choose to read it, enjoy!</h11>
