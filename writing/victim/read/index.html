<p>The quiet buzz of a fluorescent street lamp served as the sound of crickets. Its flickering the twinkle of stars. The telephone poles and dingy buildings were the boulders and trees. The rats and racoons the only wildlife.</p>
<p>Ahmod watched the scene, shrouded in the shadows of a moonless night. The soft tread of his worn sneakers was muffled, vanishing like all other sounds into the empty air. He shivered, shoving his hands deeper into the pockets of his jacket. The cool breeze, while a refreshing change from the dusty smell of his home, was chillier than he&#39;d expected.</p>
<p>It was odd. A place usually so full of shouts and honks, friendly hellos and ceaseless bartering, so empty and silent. He could only connect the two scenes by the cracks on the pavement, the marks of an old sewage leak, the rough weeds and bushes which he had seen every day. He sighed, slowly breathing in the clean air. There was something calming about the silence, even in its unnervingess. Nobody there to watch him, to judge him, to come after himâ€”or worse. Just him, the street and the empty sky, washed clean of stars by light pollution.</p>
<p>The indistinct murmur of nervous voices pierced the silence, echoing off the fronts of the buildings. Ahmod tensed, the calm broken. Another streetlamp flickered as he rounded the corner, seeing a huddle of pale faces hunched against the cold, tramping warily down the sidewalk. He sighed tensely, posture stiffening.</p>
<p>&quot;What a neighborhood.&quot; he heard a woman&#39;s voice say, with mixed fear and disgust.<br />
 &quot;Let&#39;s get out of here quickly...&quot; another woman answered, and Ahmod saw one of the figures glance around.<br />
 &quot;Let&#39;s hope we don&#39;t meet anyone,&quot; a man&#39;s voice said, somewhat roughly, &quot;I don&#39;t want to deal with any trouble.&quot;</p>
<p>The three figures glanced around, and one squeaked, noticing him for the first time. Ahmod slowed his pace, forcing his shoulders to look relaxed. The other two looked over their shoulders and eyed his dark skin, looking more nervous.</p>
<p>&quot;There&#39;s someone behind us!&quot; the second woman whispered, trying and failing to prevent her voice from reaching Ahmod.<br />
 &quot;Maybe he&#39;s just a night walker?&quot; the first woman suggested, without any real heart.<br />
 &quot;But he&#39;s...y&#39;know...<em>black...</em>&quot; the second woman whispered the last word like a curse, as if the very mention of it might invoke some creature of the darkness. Ahmod looked down, stifling his anger. <em>Keep your head down, don&#39;t make any sudden moves, keep walking.</em></p>
<p>&quot;He&#39;s <em>following us!</em>&quot; the second woman hissed, picking up her pace. The other two followed, muttering nervously. Ahmod kept on moving, waiting for the first opportunity to turn off the street.<br />
 &quot;I&#39;m gonna die in this neighborhood!&quot; the first woman whimpered, voice trembling. Ahmod forced himself to keep his pace slow, even when every cell in his body was screaming to move faster.<br />
 &quot;That&#39;s it,&quot; the man said firmly, and Ahmod heard the click of a metallic object. He didn&#39;t stop to look up, he ran. Fear and adrenaline raced through his veins as Ahmod took off, sprinting for the corner. Small rocks bounced across the asphalt, flung aside by his frantic footsteps. He spun around the corner, flattening himself against the wall, gasping for breath.<br />
 &quot;Go back to the slum you came from!&quot; Ahmod heard the man shout over the pounding of blood in his ears, &quot;we won&#39;t be your victims tonight!&quot;</p>
<p>Ahmod slid to the ground, trembling. The relieved sighs and congratulations of the women echoed around the corner, a mockery of his terror. The three kept going, their now confident voices fading away. The night was silent once more. Just the buzzing of the streetlamp, the telephone poles and dingy buildings, the quiet rummaging of the rats and racoons.</p>
<p>But all Ahmod could wonder, as tears began to come to his eyes, was who had really been the victim.</p>
