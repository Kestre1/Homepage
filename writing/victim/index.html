      <h11 class='authorsnotetext'>This is perhaps the fastest I've ever written a complete short story! Granted, that's likely because I couldn't go over 700 words, but it was a fascinating experience to not have enough time to think about any aspect enough to agonize over it. 48 hours before the submission deadline for a school magazine, I realized that the story I had intended to submit (<a href="../the-darkness/">The Darkness</a>) was far too long, and I would need to write something else. So I returned to a story idea I've been forming and reforming in my head for a long time, drafted it out, did some frantic revisions alone and with Mom, and got the piece in 9 hours before the deadline!</h11>
      <br />
      <br />
      <h11 class='authorsnotetext'>It was actually remarkable timing, because this was a piece I've been thinking about writing for a long time. It touches on an issue that I feel is often reserved for books or articles about social justice, where the author or editor would follow it with some prevalent message or tie it together with another story of its type. I hoped to avoid that by writing a story that only becomes apparent what topic it's on about halfway through the piece. I don't think this sort of writing should be saved merely for the people who seek it out, and I hoped that by illustrating my point concisely and without the usual strappings of such a story, I might accomplish that goal. Hopefully that came across in my writing!</h11>
