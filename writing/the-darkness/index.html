      <h11 class='authorsnotetext'>This short story was a labor of love. It was written at the tail end of a six week course exploring identity, and I wanted to use it to communicate a concept that I don't even know how to word straight, let alone using a fictional metaphor! This was the first complete work I've put together since my short story last Spring, and it reminded me how much I enjoy communicating ideas through stories. I hope that enjoyment came through in this piece!</h11>

      <br />
      <h11 class='authorsnotetext'>This story started out at 27 pages--in an assignment with a maximum of 4 pages--and I did manage to get it down to just 9 after feedback from my instructor. Unusually for me, I'm quite glad I did, since my 27-page-and-counting draft probably had too much additonal matter that distracted from the main point. This is where I'd usually talk about the idea behind the story, but honestly, I think this one can speak for itself. Anyways, enjoy!</h11>
