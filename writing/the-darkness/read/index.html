<p>She would be thirteen when the Darkness came for her.</p>
<p>That was what the elders proclaimed, bent-backed and wizened by their time, on the day of her birth. That was what her parents had told her, the day they returned to it. That was what she had seen in her brothers and sisters as they convulsed on the floor, bleeding an inky blackness that swallowed all light. The inky blackness that almost seemed to pool in their rooms on the darkest of nights, ominous and silent. Waiting.</p>
<p>But she was not going to go with it.</p>
<p>The gentle breeze was pleasantly cool, softening the edge of the blazing sun hovering above. Crows swarmed overhead, roused from their heat-induced slumber by the appearance of some threatening bird of prey. Ayomide strained, pushing the water pump up and down. The repetitive motion was welcome, soothing her swirling thoughts.</p>
<p>&quot;Eniyan mi. <em>My people.&quot; Mama Ifede stepped into the circle of torches, time-hardened face grim. &quot;We are gathered to witness the coming of another of our tribe into the Darkness.&quot; Ayomide shivered, as the faces of her tribespeople turned to her. &quot;One more of our Daughters, Ayomide, has reached thirteen winters, the age of the</em> irubo Annabi. <em>The age when she may be claimed for service by</em> apanirun ati olugbala wa<em>, the Darkness That Takes All. Let us mark the passing of her childhood, the last moment when she may truly belong to those of us on this world, before she is seized like we all shall inevitably be...&quot;</em></p>
<p>A repeated splashing noise broke Ayomide&#39;s concentration, and she dimly realized that the bucket had been pumped full. She sighed, wiping her brow, and turned back towards the clearing. It was hard to imagine, in the heat and merciless brightness of such a day, that the Darkness might be prowling alongside her, waiting for its chance to strike. Ayomide could almost convince herself that nothing was wrong, that the night which sealed her fate had never really happened.</p>
<p>&quot;AYOMIDE!&quot; an excited voice exclaimed, and members of her tribe were knocked out of the way as a small shape came barreling forward, latching onto Ayomide&#39;s legs.
 &quot;Tujuka!&quot; Ayomide laughed in spite of herself.
 &quot;Ayomide, look what I found!&quot; Tujuka grinned up at her older sister, holding up a long, muddy worm.
 &quot;Tujuka!&quot; Ayomide scolded good-naturedly, &quot;you know you shouldn&#39;t go digging for worms! They don&#39;t like being out in the sun with us!&quot;
 &quot;But this one looked so sad!&quot; Tujuka whined, &quot;its puddle of mud was drying up! I had to save it!&quot;
 Ayomide chuckled. &quot;Then go ahead and find it a new home!&quot; Tujuka squealed excitedly, and started off towards a puddle of mud. After a second, however, she turned around with a look of quiet seriousness on her face.
 &quot;You&#39;ll be here when I come back, right?&quot;
 Ayomide swallowed, her stomach dropping. But she smiled. &quot;I&#39;ll be here.&quot; Tujuka grinned hopefully, then bounded off, already chattering excitedly to herself. Ayomide watched her run, the cold feeling in her core still lingering.</p>
<p>&quot;You shouldn&#39;t lead her on like that.&quot; a voice said from behind her. Ayomide didn&#39;t need to turn around to know it was Mama Ifede.
 &quot;I&#39;m not leading her on.&quot; She said firmly, &quot;The Darkness can come after me, try to drag me down with ten thousand of its <em>apá</em>, but I will not go. For Tujuka&#39;s sake, for all of your sakes!&quot;
 Mama Ifede looked at Ayomide sadly. &quot;My dear child,&quot; she said, &quot;there is no way to resist the darkness.&quot;
 &quot;I don&#39;t care!&quot; Ayomide yelled, &quot;I&#39;m going to do it, even if it kills me!&quot; And she marched off towards the tribe house, the water in her bucket splashing out like a trail of tears.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>Pale, pre-dawn light slithered through the cracks in the ceiling, dimly lighting the corridors of the tribe house. All was silent. It was early, after all—Mama Ifede and the other Elders would sleep until the sun had risen over the horizon, as they always did. Ayomide padded through the halls, looking but not seeing, lost in her memories.</p>
<p><em>Tujuka grinning as she proudly presented the fish she had caught with her own bare hands to Ayomide.
 Mama Ifede wobbling as she leaned on Ayomide&#39;s arm, exhausted.
 Her parents crying as the darkness swallowed their bodies, ripping them away from their children.</em></p>
<p>Tujuka was never allowed parents. She was the youngest, only three when the Darkness returned to claim their parents. And as each one of their siblings was taken, Ayomide became her mother. Her protector. The closest thing to a parent anybody had, outside of the Elders. And of course the Elders tried their best, but after serving their sixty years in the Darkness since their thirteenth birthdays, they were cowed and exhausted, relying on those younger while they lived out their final years recovering from the toil. <em>If I leave, who will look after Tujuka? Mama Ifede? Any of the Elders?</em></p>
<p>&quot;Ayomide?&quot; a small voice asked. Ayomide whirled around, but the hallway was empty.
 &quot;Tujuka, where are you?&quot;
 &quot;Ayomide...&quot; Ayomide cast around, looking for the source of the voice, but the hallway was empty.
 &quot;Tujuka, I can&#39;t see you, come out!&quot;
 &quot;Ayo<em>MIDE!</em>&quot; The lights went out. The shadows began to move on the walls, twisting into deformed shapes, watching. Ayomide felt her blood run cold, as the Darkness welled up from the floor in bubbling spurts, gathering and twisting and changing all around her.
 &quot;NO!&quot; she yelled, &quot;I won&#39;t go with you!&quot;
<em>&quot;Ayomide...&quot;</em> the voices whispered, no longer Tujuka&#39;s voice at all. The tendrils advanced, reaching out to touch her.
 &quot;GO AWAY!&quot; Ayomide grabbed her dagger from her belt and slashed at the tendrils, severing them. The Darkness recoiled, retreating to the swirling mass ascending like a tornado around her.</p>
<p>&quot;<em>Come...come...come...&quot;</em>
&quot;Leave now and don&#39;t come back!&quot; Ayomide yelled, brandishing her dagger.
<em>&quot;Come...come...come...&quot;</em>
&quot;Try to take me. I dare you!!&quot;
<em>&quot;Come...Come...COME!!&quot;</em>
The Darkness surged towards her, reaching out with a thousand hands of shadow.
 &quot;Leave NOW!!&quot; Ayomide sank her dagger into the mass, stabbing it with all the fury and pain and fear it had brought to her. With a horrible scream, the darkness ripped into pieces, dissolving into the air like black flames.</p>
<p>And then it was over. The shadows were gone. Ayomide collapsed to the ground, limbs shaking, feeling somehow hollow inside.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>The gentle breeze was pleasantly cool, but it did little to calm the blaze of fear within. Crows swarmed overhead, roused once more from their heat-induced slumber by a new enemy which they would throw themselves at with reckless abandon. Ayomide strained, pushing the water pump up and down. The repetitive motion, once so welcome, did little to soothe the tempest of her thoughts.</p>
<p>&quot;<em>Ayomide... Come...&quot;</em> She had fought the Darkness off, yes, but how could she stop that force? That power, which without ever having touched her, weakened her until she could barely stand. If it came back...</p>
<p>Ayomide collapsed against the pump, crying. It was all too much. <em>How can I resist the Darkness and still serve my tribe? What will the young ones do if I leave? Or the Elders?</em></p>
<p><em>Bwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa...</em> Ayomide&#39;s head shot up, blood turning to ice. She knew that sound. The horn signal meant only one thing: the tribe was under attack.</p>
<p>Ayomide sprang from the ground, bucket forgotten, and sprinted for the clearing. Already, the yells of battle began to sound over the fatal drumbeat of heavy footsteps echoing on the terrain. Bursting into the clearing, Ayomide felt her stomach drop in fear. People were everywhere, crashing through the foliage into the clearing, grabbing at anything in sight that looked valuable.</p>
<p>&quot;Help!&quot;
 Ayomide whirled around, seeing with horror Tujuka backed up against a tree, cornered by a sword-clad woman.
 &quot;Sorry <em>ọmọ,</em> it&#39;s nothing personal, but we needed the resources.&quot; she said and raised her sword.
 &quot;No!&quot; Ayomide yelled, and shoved the woman out of the way, knocking her to the ground. The woman rolled then leapt to her feet, already swinging her sword.</p>
<p>Desperately, Ayomide flung up her dagger, trying to block the woman&#39;s strike. Their blades clashed, twisting Ayomide&#39;s wrists in painful directions. Ayomide gripped her dagger desperately, but the woman pounded into it again and again, knocking it from her hands. The woman sighed in brisk triumph.
 &quot;Any last words?&quot;</p>
<p>Ayomide fell to her knees, resolve failing with her blade. <em>I&#39;ve failed them. She&#39;ll kill me, then she and her raiding party will take everything from us.</em> She lowered her head, tears coming to her eyes. <em>All that struggle, all that pain, and for what?</em></p>
<p>Then all of a sudden the despair was gone, and in its place Ayomide felt a great wave of determination surge through her veins. She looked up, lifting her chin and staring with a blazing defiance.
 &quot;Leave. Now.&quot; And she leapt from the ground, thrusting her hands outwards.</p>
<p>The defiance surged, rushing through Ayomide&#39;s arms and straight through her palms. The Darkness roared outwards, slamming into the wide-eyed woman. It twisted and flew, raging like a hurricane, throwing the invaders off their feet. It poured from her hands, her chest, her heart, forming and reforming not from the shadows around her but from a place deep within. But it was not terrible, like the Darkness that had ripped through her siblings, it was beautiful.</p>
<p>Ayomide turned to the woman and repeated her words, amplified by all the weight of the Darkness.
 &quot;Leave. NOW!&quot; The woman nodded, trembling in terror, and motioned to her fellows who were more than happy to oblige. Ayomide sighed, and the Darkness calmed, returning to its place inside her.</p>
<p>&quot;What did you just do?&quot; Mama Ifede breathed, staring in wonder with the rest of her tribespeople. Ayomide smiled.
 &quot;I understood.&quot;
 Content and pride swirled inside Ayomide, twisting and changing and bringing other emotions with them, just like the shadows that were brought by the Darkness. Ayomide came and kissed Mama Ifede on the cheek.
 &quot;It&#39;s time for me to go now, but I think you can handle yourselves.&quot;
 Mama Ifede smiled, tears coming to her eyes. &quot;Of course we will.&quot;</p>
<p>Ayomide stepped away and turned, walking towards the forest.
 &quot;Where are you going?&quot; Tujuka asked. Ayomide turned to face her.
 &quot;Into the Darkness. Where else?&quot;</p>
<p>Calm swirled within Ayomide, spreading outwards in the veil of Darkness that began to surround her. Ayomide didn&#39;t flinch as she watched the shadows grow and change. Because now she finally understood. The Darkness was not some beast, some entity prowling in the forest that claimed those of her tribe, it was something within them. The source of their confidence and arrogance, bravery and anger, hate and kindness. There was no resisting the Darkness because there was no resisting herself. That was why she felt such pain when she fought it off.</p>
<p>So for the first time, as the Darkness swirled around her, letting her dematerialize from the world she knew, Ayomide did not fight. It was time to discover what lay within the Darkness. What lay within her.</p>
