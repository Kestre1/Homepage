	  <h10>The job of a valiant knight is simple. Make heroic poses, valorous speeches, slash the sword a couple times, and bring back the head of a dragon! Or, at least, that's what Sir Hanson Grandious assumed, before he actually had to do it...</h10>

      <h11 class='authorsnotetext'>I'm rather proud of this short story! As it was written as part of a writing class I took, I followed a process very different from my usual writing process. First, I wrote a draft of the story at the beginning of the class. Then I went through six weeks of writing course in which along with a usual assignment I would need to propose changes to my initial draft of this story. Finally, at the very end, I revised my previous draft using my own feedback and the feedback of my writing coach. Sure, I do revise, but this was probably the best revision process I've had in years!</h11>

      <br />
      <h11 class='authorsnotetext'>The idea behind this story was just to create something of amusement that pertains to the ridiculous idea that knights in shining armor are a good thing. You'll see this a lot in other short stories set in medeival times. I hope it is as amusing to read as it was to write!</h11>
