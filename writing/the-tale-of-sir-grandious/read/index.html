<p id='firstline'>Sir Hanson Grandious, gallant knight of the Kingdom of Raginor, hero of infinite courage, was having a very bad day.</p>

<p>Not just a regularly sized, get-stuck-in-a-swamp-and-lose-your-horse bad day. No, this was a bad day of epic proportions.</p>

<p>Granted, Hanson enjoyed a wonderful morning, arriving bright and early at the small village that had called for help. He moved through the streets astride his horse, to the cheers of the townsfolk in their somewhat decrepit, ordinary homes. The mayor came to meet him, suitably unkempt and without decorum, and begged him to slay the terrible Dragon that had been plaguing their area for many weeks. Hanson, naturally, accepted.</p>

<p>Hanson set off well, shining armor dazzling the cheering townsfolk, who interrupted any task to throw flowers in his direction. He enjoyed a brisk trot up the sheer mountain to the lair of the dragon, which was adequately high up to cause any regular man to tremble. <em>But no, not Sir Grandious,</em> Hanson thought to himself, <em>Sir Grandious fears no small drop! Not when he has dragons to face!</em> That thought had sent him happily on his way, keeping his posture ramrod straight and gaze properly chivalrous.</p>

<p>But it started to go wrong when he discovered that the yawning cave where the dragon supposedly slept was hollow. Hanson scratched his head, staring at the light he could see at the end of the tunnel. This was all highly unorthodox. <em>Caves are not supposed to be hollow!</em></p>

<p>Then it got worse when Hanson followed it through, and found himself in the middle of paradise. The grass underfoot was as soft and lush as the fur of a hare, the wildflowers dabs of bright paint spread as liberally as one might spread trash on their least favorite neighbors yard while they were out of town. The air was alive with the fresh aroma of dew, sunlight, and the honey-sweet scent of pollen.</p>

<p>Hanson scowled. What could be a less valiant scene for a confrontation with a mighty beast? When they sung songs about his great deeds, would he be remembered battling a winged reptile in a picturesque meadow? No, no, that would not do at all.</p>

<p>Good mood spoiled, he stomped through the valley, searching for his target. The fragrant grass felt pleasant underfoot, bending and springing back up with startling vitality. No matter how folded a flower was after Hanson stepped on it, it always sprung back up without a care in the world. That aggravated Hanson terribly. Plants near a dragon were supposed to be wilted and decrepit! How could venturing into the Desolation of a dragon be a valiant deed if the Desolation wasn&#39;t desolate? This was already going badly, and Hanson hadn&#39;t even found the dragon yet. <em>Calm yourself, Hanson.</em> The knight thought to himself, <em>just focus on locating the beast.</em></p>

<p>It didn&#39;t take long. After all, there are few places one can hide a fiery orange, seventy-foot-long dragon. Spying it&#39;s massive frame, Hanson rushed forward, reaching for his sword... And stopped in his tracks, heart sinking.</p>

<p>It was sleeping. The dragon actually had the gall to be fast asleep when his future slayer approached, with blazing eyes and flashing sword! Hanson stomped his foot in annoyance. It was so easy in the ballads. The dragon was always waiting to welcome the knight with a feral roar and a few deadly fireballs, then the valiant figure in shining armor would leap forward and drive a sword into the foul beast&#39;s chest. None of this nonsense about meadows and <em>sleeping</em>, of all things!</p>

<p>Hanson sat down, resolving to wait for the dragon to wake up. <em>It will have to soon enough,</em> he reasoned, <em>and then I&#39;ll poke it to aggravate it, let it shake its grogginess, and have my glorious encounter, simple as that. All I need to do is draw on my abundant patience.</em></p>

<p>Hanson&#39;s abundant patience ran out in about thirty seconds. Giving up on his original plan, Hanson lowered himself to the disgraceful act of shouting,</p>

<p>&quot;WAKE UP, YOU STUPID BEAST!&quot;</p>

<p>That was certainly enough to wake the dragon. With a blood-curdling snort, it began to breathe more shallowly, eyelids fluttering. A low growl echoed across the meadow, as paws clenched against the ground, raising a long, muscular body like that of a glistening sea serpent on land. Finally, two massive eyes the color of raging fire opened, orienting with narrow pupils on Sir Grandious. Then, lifting its neck high and flaring out its wings, the dragon roared a terrible roar.</p>

<p>Hanson laughed into the face of the gust of air and spittle. Now that was an adequate confrontation beginning!</p>

<p>Drawing his sword with a flourish, Sir Grandious raised his weapon hand into the air.</p>

<p>&quot;FIGHT ME, FOUL CREATURE!!&quot;</p>

<p>The dragon seemed to need no prompting. It let out a whoosh of smoky air, then opened its jaws wide...</p>

<p>And panted.</p>

<p>Hanson gaped, unable to comprehend what he was seeing.</p>

<p>The dragon continued to pant, excitable slobber dripping from a fang-encrusted mouth. The long, scaly muzzle did not look so fearsome contorted into an innocent smile, almost like the head of a reptilian, oversized dog.</p>

<p>&quot;Wh-what...?&quot; Hanson stammered. This was not happening. <em>The dragon is supposed to roar! Supposed to try to kill me! Supposed to at least look evil!</em></p>

<p>The dragon whined, cocking its head. Its gaze oriented on the sword, following its slight wavering curiously with its eyes. Scandalized, Sir Grandious lowered the sword and tried to cover it with his arms. It would greatly deplete the majesty of his weapon if he allowed it to be gazed upon in awe by the very creature it would kill! But the dragon&#39;s eyes followed the shiny metal, its panting halting as if mesmerized.</p>

<p>Hanson sighed. <em>Well, at least I&#39;m the only one in the meadow. All I have to do is bring the dragon&#39;s head back, and hope no one asks too many questions while composing a ballad about my bravery.</em> Still, he felt betrayed. Were the ballads lying? <em>No! They can&#39;t! What about Long Hair the Brave? Big Muscles the Mighty? My heroes can&#39;t be lies!</em></p>

<p>Hanson thought back despairingly to the tales of bravery and courage that had burned him to train and train to the proud moment four months previous when he had been inducted as a knight, to serve the Kingdom within the Laws of Chivalry. No matter that he had never actually fought a dragon, indeed, he had fended off no more than five brigands and thieves on separate occasions, but that didn&#39;t matter. The ballads could not lie!</p>

<p>Aggravating the situation further, the dragon wagged its tail, sniffing the air around it with gusto. That was the last straw for Hanson. With a roar, he charged the dragon, raising his sword like a spear and hurling it straight for the dragon&#39;s eye.</p>

<p>The dragon stopped sniffing for a moment to watch its impending doom sail with deadly intent some ten feet to the left of it. With a <em>very</em> heroic thudding noise, the sword embedded itself on the other side of the meadow. Hanson stared at it in dismay. <em>That was not supposed to happen...</em></p>

<p>Suddenly, thundering footfalls nearly knocked Hanson to the ground as the dragon bounded after the sword, reaching it in seconds and bending down to grasp it in its massive mouth. Satisfied with the sword&#39;s security, the dragon bounded back to Sir Grandious, dropping the now slobbery sword at his feet.</p>

<p>Had it been possible, Hanson&#39;s jaw would have dropped to the region of his feet. He was trained to deliver heroic monologues, flash his sword in any form of sunlight from any direction, and leap from ground to horse and back in a matter of seconds, but he had definitely never been taught what to do if a dragon didn&#39;t try to kill you, somehow evaded your <em>perfect</em> aim, and defiled your sword with slobber.</p>

<p>The dragon obliviously wagged its tail again, and nudged the sword, signalling that it wanted to play fetch a second time. With a strangled noise of fury and disgust, Hanson snatched the sword, and hurled it at the dragon once more.</p>

<p>Once more, his unsteady aim missed. Swords were not, despite their pointyness, meant for throwing.</p>

<p>This time, the dragon didn&#39;t wait. With a prodigious leap, it launched into the air, snatched the sword out of the sky, and returned it enthusiastically to Hanson. Staring at the excessively slobbery sword in frustration, Hanson found no other course of action than to throw the weapon again. The dragon caught it, and brought it back with no decline in enthusiasm. Abandoning the notion of a perfect hit right between the eyes, Hanson aimed for the heart. The dragon just bent its neck to catch the sword in its slobbery jaws as it flew. Hanson launched the sword again. The dragon brought it back. And again. The dragon brought it back. And again. The dragon brought it back. No matter how many times the knight hurled his sword with the intention to kill, the dragon simply returned it enthusiastically to Hanson.</p>

<p>Finally, Hanson snapped. Screaming in frustration, he sunk to the ground, pounding his fists against the grass. And though he knew it was not particularly heroic, Hanson began to sob, consumed by despair.</p>

<p>Seeing his behavior, the dragon nuzzled the top of Hanson&#39;s head. Hanson didn&#39;t even have the energy to swat it. It was all wrong. Everything was wrong.</p>

<p>&quot;I&#39;m just trying to kill a dragon!&quot; Hanson wailed, &quot;Why is it going so wrong?!! Why meeeeeee!!!&quot;</p>

<p>The dragon whined, a worried look creasing its brow. After much deliberation, it came to a decision, and bent its neck again, grabbing Hanson by the scruff of his shining armor and lifting him off the ground.</p>

<p>Fury and sadness were suddenly replaced by fear, as Hanson realized that he had suddenly found himself in the jaws of the not-so-proverbial dragon. Kicked and screaming, he swung his fists wildly, scoring many fatal hits on the air, but not much else. Still the dragon thundered on, marching through the meadow to a cave Hanson hadn&#39;t spied before.</p>

<p>Then as did he spy it, a prickle of pure terror passed down his spine. <em>Oh no...</em> Hanson thought, as he realized what was going on. The dragon was taking him to its lair. <em>I am about to die.</em></p>

<p>But there was nothing he could do. Despite his screaming and threatening, the dragon took him inexorably closer to the dark mouth of the cave, until finally, the darkness swallowed them.</p>

<p>It took a moment for Hanson&#39;s eyes to adjust to the gloom, but when they did, he gasped. Gathered in a great pile in the center of the cave was any object someone might throw. Shoes, balls, leaves, a good number of pitchforks, bows, arrows, and many other assorted objects including a wedding dress, tomato, and bag of ox blood. Hanson stared at the pile in confusion. This was the dragon&#39;s hoard? No gems. No gold. No fair maidens of any sort.</p>

<p>Then suddenly, the pieces of the puzzle fit together.</p>

<p>&quot;Ooooooooooooh!&quot; Hanson realized. He could almost see it. &#39;<em>Dusk falling, the dragon leaving the meadow to find food and something to play with. Passing over the town. The screams of the villagers drawing the dragon downwards. Then the throwing, of any object that might have the slightest hope of deterring the fire-breathing beast, but...&#39;</em></p>

<p>&quot;The &#39;ravaging&#39; you do is actually just trying to play fetch with the projectiles launched at you by the villagers!&quot;</p>

<p>The dragon panted as best it could with a knight hanging from its mouth, as it sensed Hanson&#39;s change in mood from frustration to understanding. Then Hanson&#39;s scowl put an end to its panting.</p>

<p>&quot;This is not good!&quot; Hanson groaned. &quot;How am I supposed to courageously slay a dragon if it isn&#39;t attacking me? It&#39;s outside the Laws of Chivalry (bless their sacred name)!&quot; He slumped, feeling defeated. <em>All I wanted was to do one big heroic deed! Just one, to prove that I am worthy of really being a knight!</em> He thought sadly to himself, <em>And this-this</em> stupid <em>dragon had to ruin it by not being evil!</em></p>

<p>Dispiritedly, Hanson lowered his eyes to the treasure trove of trash, despairing. Dimly, he noticed a large blue ball in the pile, and wondered how that had gotten there. <em>Not particularly surprising though,</em> Hanson thought idly, <em>if a bag of ox blood could get here, anything could.</em></p>

<p>Hanson sighed. Then, suddenly, his head shot up. <em>Wait. A bag of ox blood, a ball, and a dragon who wants to play fetch...</em></p>

<p>And suddenly, an idea occurred to him. A very unmanly idea. Hanson immediately tried to dismiss it, but it had already taken hold. <em>After all,</em> a treacherous part of his brain said, <em>many say chivalry is dead...</em> And a slow smiled spread over his lips.</p>

<center><strong><p>~</p></strong></center>

<p>An hour later, the loud crack of a blade on something sharp sounded from the mountain, and a terrible roar issued from the mouth of the dragon&#39;s lair. The villagers gazed in mixed awe and horror at the place where the dragon emerged every night, and then gasped as a splash of red liquid poured from the cave. Then something else stepped out into the light.</p>

<p>Sir Hanson Grandious, armor shining, sword unsheathed, strode out of the cave and raised his weapon arm in a sign of victory. The villagers cheered. The dragon was no more!</p>

<p>Sir Grandious got a very warm welcome when he arrived at the town, modded by a parade of grateful villagers as he strode down the main street to a stream of rice confetti. Finally, he was greeted by the Mayor.</p>

<p>&quot;Honored Knight, we are forever in thy debt!&quot; the Mayor said, bowing low. Sir Grandious accepted the gesture with a gracious nod. The Mayor looked up, slightly embarrassed. &quot;Er...would you happen to know what happened to the head of the dragon?&quot;</p>

<p>Sir Grandious smiled calmly.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, I had intended to bring it back as a trophy to you, but the dragon exploded as I stabbed it in the underbelly. I must have hit the fire stomach. Terrible business, slaying dragons. I barely escaped with my life!&quot;</p>

<p>The villagers gasped and swooned, a few fainting dead out on the street. The Mayor nodded, clearly relieved that he had not offended the knight.</p>

<p>&quot;Of course! We would never doubt the word of a hero of your stature!&quot;</p>

<p>Inside, Hanson chuckled. He thought his plan was quite ingenious, really. The sense of pride that had started when Hanson had popped the bag of ox blood at the mouth of the dragon&#39;s tunnel had not diminished one bit. Though the nagging voice that had insisted he was doing the wrong thing had as he yelled &quot;fetch!&quot; and tossed the blue ball down the mountain for the dragon to chase had reduced in volume quite considerably. And of course, he didn&#39;t really need to try. There wasn&#39;t much to getting a dragon to chase an object down the far side of a mountain into the adjoining ocean, Hanson had discovered. And he supposed that was what Long Hair the Brave and Big Muscles the Mighty must have realized. The knights got the attention and gratitude of the Kingdom&#39;s peasants, and the dragons, Hanson suspected, chased their objects far out into sea until they found some island or unexplored volcano where they could live in peace, chasing fish and leaves to their heart&#39;s content without interfering with any Kingdom business. In the end, it didn&#39;t really matter whether the ballads were real or not. Hanson didn&#39;t have to slay any dragons to be a very accomplished knight. And armed with that thought, Hanson strode off to the feast being hosted in his honor.</p>

<p>Sir Hanson Grandious, gallant knight of the Kingdom of Raginor, Dragon Slayer extraordinaire, was having a very good afternoon.</p>
