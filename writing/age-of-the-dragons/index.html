	    <h10>Hiccup Horrendous Haddock XXV and the new Dragon Riders have already traveled a long way since the original five found the Barbaric Archipelago. But now, after discovering dragons and discovering themselves, they have one more thing to do. Perhaps the hardest so far. Convince the world that dragons can be trusted.</h10>
	    <br />
	    <br />
	    <h10>The riders must return to the world they were removed from, with the intent of transforming it into a new world. But the new world has dark secrets. Secrets that could destroy everything...</h10>

      <br />
      <br />
      <h11 class='authorsnotetext'>DISCLAIMER: If you bash your brains out while reading this book to spare yourself the torture of continued consumption, I don't blame you!</h11>
      <br />
      <br />
      <h11 class='authorsnotetext'>This is by far the longest and worst book I've ever written! Not that there's much to compare it to... This was written in a whirlwind of choppy writing from March 2020 to March 2020 (also known as February 2021), from neglect during the school year to a flurry of practically non-stop writing during the summer. And although this book has more plot holes than words, and takes so long to ramp up that even I got bored when I was rereading it, I think it was an especially fun book to write!</h11>
      <br />
      <br />
      <h11 class='authorsnotetext'>This book was very heavy on battles and strategy, in a series already heavy on battles and strategy, which was an intentional move on my part intended to make it fit better with the movies it is based off of. I don't particularly enjoy writing battles, but I had plenty to write here, unfortunately. Still, the whole process of writing vigorous battles and long stretches of boredom was rather fun for me, if not for a reader!</h11>
      <br />
      <br />
      <h11 class='authorsnotetext'>Once again, this is hardly my best work, but the way I see it, it's still work, and still fun too, which is all I'm looking for!</h11>
